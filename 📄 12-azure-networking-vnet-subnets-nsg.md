## **Chapter 12: Azure Networking Services (VNET, Subnets, NSG)**  

### **1. Introduction to Azure Networking**  
Azure Networking Services provide a **secure, scalable, and high-performance** networking infrastructure for Azure workloads. In this chapter, we will cover:  
âœ… **Virtual Networks (VNETs)** â†’ Private, isolated networks in Azure.  
âœ… **Subnets** â†’ Logical network segments within a VNET.  
âœ… **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** â†’ Firewall rules to control inbound/outbound traffic.

### **2. Azure Virtual Network (VNET)**  

#### **What is a VNET?**  
An **Azure Virtual Network (VNET)** is a **private, isolated** network that allows Azure resources to securely communicate with each other and external networks.  

#### **Key Features**  
- **Custom IP Addressing** â†’ Define custom private IP ranges.  
- **Subnets** â†’ Segment networks for better security and performance.  
- **Secure Connectivity** â†’ Use VPNs, ExpressRoute, or Peering.  
- **Traffic Filtering** â†’ NSGs control traffic flow.  

#### **Use Cases**  
- Deploying a **multi-tier application** (Web + App + Database).  
- Connecting on-premises networks to Azure using a **VPN Gateway**.

### **3. Azure Subnets**  

#### **What is a Subnet?**  
A **subnet** is a **smaller network within a VNET** used to organize and control Azure resources.  

#### **Key Features**  
- **Traffic Isolation** â†’ Separate traffic between workloads (e.g., Web, App, DB).  
- **Security** â†’ Apply different NSG rules per subnet.  
- **Scaling** â†’ Optimize performance by segmenting network traffic.  

#### **Example**  
A company deploys:  
- **Subnet-1 (Web Tier)** â†’ Hosts public-facing web servers.  
- **Subnet-2 (App Tier)** â†’ Hosts internal application services.  
- **Subnet-3 (DB Tier)** â†’ Hosts secure databases with restricted access.

### **4. Network Security Groups (NSG)**  

#### **What is an NSG?**  
A **Network Security Group (NSG)** is a **firewall** that controls inbound and outbound traffic to **Azure VMs, Subnets, and Services**.  

#### **How NSGs Work?**  
- **Inbound Rules** â†’ Control incoming traffic (e.g., allow HTTP/HTTPS).  
- **Outbound Rules** â†’ Control outgoing traffic (e.g., restrict internet access).  
- **Priority-Based** â†’ Rules are **evaluated in order (Lowest â†’ Highest)**.  

#### **Example NSG Rules**  
| **Rule**   | **Source**  | **Destination** | **Port**  | **Action** |  
|-----------|------------|---------------|-----------|------------|  
| Allow SSH | Any        | VM1           | TCP 22    | Allow      |  
| Allow HTTP| Any        | Web Server    | TCP 80    | Allow      |  
| Deny All  | Any        | Any           | Any       | Deny       |  

ðŸ’¡ **Best Practice**: Apply **NSGs at the Subnet level** instead of individual VMs for **better management**.
