# **Essential Cloud & Azure Terms**  

*A collection of essential cloud and Azure computing terms to help understand fundamental concepts.*  

---  

## üìå **Cloud Concepts**  

- **Cloud Computing**  
  The delivery of computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software, etc.) over the internet instead of on-premises infrastructure.  

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**  
  A cloud service model providing virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking.  

- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**  
  A cloud service model offering a platform for developing, running, and managing applications without managing infrastructure.  

- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**  
  A cloud service model where applications are hosted and managed by a provider and accessed via the internet.

## üí∞ **Cost Management**  

- **CapEx (Capital Expenditure)**  
  Upfront investment in physical hardware, software, and infrastructure.  

- **OpEx (Operational Expenditure)**  
  Ongoing costs for cloud services based on a pay-as-you-go model.  

- **Pay-as-You-Go**  
  A pricing model where customers pay only for the resources they use.  

- **Reserved Instances (RI)**  
  A cloud pricing option where customers commit to using a resource for a long-term period (e.g., 1-3 years) for cost savings.  

- **Spot Instances**  
  A discounted pricing model for unused cloud capacity, offering lower prices for non-critical workloads.  

- **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**  
  A financial estimate that includes both direct and indirect costs of owning and operating IT infrastructure.  

---  

## üîê **Security & Responsibility**  

- **Shared Responsibility Model**  
  A security framework defining responsibilities between the cloud provider and the customer.  

- **Multi-Tenancy**  
  A cloud architecture where multiple customers share the same computing resources securely.

## ‚ö° **Scalability & Performance**  

- **Scalability**  
  The ability to increase or decrease computing resources as needed.  

- **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up/Down)**  
  Increasing or decreasing the power of an existing resource (e.g., upgrading a VM's CPU or RAM).  

- **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out/In)**  
  Adding or removing instances of a resource (e.g., increasing the number of VMs).  

- **Elasticity**  
  The capability of automatically scaling resources up or down to match demand.  

---  

## üèóÔ∏è **Cloud Migration & Deployment**  

- **Virtual Machine (VM)**  
  A software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications.  

- **Lift and Shift**  
  A cloud migration strategy where applications are moved to the cloud with minimal changes.  

- **Hybrid Cloud**  
  A computing environment that combines on-premises infrastructure with cloud services.  

- **Public Cloud**  
  Cloud services offered by third-party providers over the internet, available to anyone.  

- **Private Cloud**  
  Cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single organization.  

- **High Availability (HA)**  
  Ensuring that a system remains operational with minimal downtime.  

- **Fault Tolerance**  
  The ability of a system to continue running despite failures (e.g., redundant cloud servers).  

- **Load Balancer**  
  A service that distributes traffic across multiple resources to ensure availability and performance.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **Azure & Cloud Services**  

- **Azure**  
  Microsoft‚Äôs cloud computing platform offering various services, including IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  

- **Azure VPN Gateway**  
  A cloud service that connects on-premises networks to Azure securely.  

- **Azure Arc**  
  A hybrid cloud management tool that allows managing on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge environments from Azure.
